# Screenshot taker
Some stuff that helps me and my team in everyday struggle :)
My team have to do every day check of advertisements on various www pages. 
Pages on which company we work for advertises itself, and on which our competitors also put their 
display ads. I hope to automate the process of going trough every single page and taking
a screenshot of all ads manually.

## Written in:

Python v 3.11

### Required extensions

1. selenium -> web navigation and interaction
2. webdriver_manager -> managing web driver implementation
3. pyautogui -> taking and saving screenshot of the whole screen.

**MEMO**

Today (20.07.2023) webdriver_manager started to generate problems. It seems it cannot locate the url to download 
latest version of chromedriver. As a mitigation I've added a path to driver on my hard drive. 
So please keep that in mind, if it suddenly stops working one day also.
